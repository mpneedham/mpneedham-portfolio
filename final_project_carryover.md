# Department of Defense: Depot Maintenance Carryover â€“ 
A Perspective of Complex Calculations and Uncertainty Impacting the U.S. Army

In this section I will walk you through my journey of developing wireframes and storyboards for Depot Maintenance Carryover.  It is a challenging topic for the U.S. Army, related to the annual budget request to Congress.  It is a very complicated topic that has many different aspects, each of which could be contributing to the problem.

# Goal: To Introduce the Challenge
How do I take such a complicated issue and break it apart?  It is difficult for individuals who work with the U.S. Army's budget to try and understand the problem.  What is the best way to tell the story to anybody?  Well, I tried, and had to try again.

# Take 1:  Setup, Conflict, Problem, Resolution
Four steps to build my storyboard, four steps to make things complicated.  Here is what I started with:

If you try to read it, it is a mess.  There is a lot going on.  I definately realized it is not an introductory story that I was attempting to tell, rather an advanced one that only someone with a good deal of familiarity would understand.  But it did allow me to realize a few other things.

1. In the setup, the reader has to be able to connect with it.  Readers will likely not know what depot maintenance is, but they can relate to maintenance of their own vehicle.  Carryover is related to the budget submission, but how can I get a reader to quickly understand the basic principles of carryover.  And as carryover is work carrying over from the previous fiscal year, okay, I also have to get them to understand just casually what a fiscal year is.  

2. The conflict gets to the budget, which drives workforce reductions, which are two areas that had an impact to carryover.  These are likely not the only areas, but trying to present more will likely introduce confusion.  The need to keep it simple.

3. The problem I was intially introducing, carryover expressed by months, is another topic for further discussion.  The problem is carryover for the U.S. Army exceeds the allowable amount and I should simply introduce that.

4. My resolution was confusing to myself.  The call to action - additional areas impacting the issue.  Each area can then build a new chapter of the story.
