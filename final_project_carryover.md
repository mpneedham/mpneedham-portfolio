# Department of Defense: Depot Maintenance Carryover â€“ 
A Perspective of Complex Calculations and Uncertainty Impacting the U.S. Army

In this section I will walk you through my journey of developing wireframes and storyboards for Depot Maintenance Carryover.  It is a challenging topic for the U.S. Army, related to the annual budget request to Congress.  It is a very complicated topic that has many different aspects, each of which could be contributing to the problem.

# Goal: To Introduce the Challenge
How do I take such a complicated issue and break it apart?  It is difficult for individuals who work with the U.S. Army's budget to try and understand the problem.  What is the best way to tell the story to anybody?  Well, I tried, and had to try again.

# Take 1:  Setup, Conflict, Problem, Resolution
Four steps to build my storyboard, four steps to make things complicated.  Here is what I started with:

<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/Carryover Story 1a.jpeg" alt="Carryover1a" width="300"> <img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/Carryover Story 1b.jpeg" alt="Carryover1b" width="300">

If you try to read it, it is a mess.  There is a lot going on.  I definitely realized it is not an introductory story that I was attempting to tell, rather an advanced one that only someone with a good deal of familiarity would understand.  But it did allow me to realize a few other things.

1. In the setup, the reader has to be able to connect with it.  Readers will likely not know what depot maintenance is, but they can relate to maintenance of their own vehicle.  Carryover is related to the budget submission, but how can I get a reader to quickly understand the basic principles of carryover.  And as carryover is work carrying over from the previous fiscal year, okay, I also have to get them to understand just casually what a fiscal year is.  

2. The conflict gets to the budget, which drives workforce reductions, which are two areas that had an impact to carryover.  These are likely not the only areas, but trying to present more will likely introduce confusion.  The need to keep it simple.

3. The problem I was initially introducing, carryover expressed by months, is another topic for further discussion.  The problem is carryover for the U.S. Army exceeds the allowable amount and I should simply introduce that.

4. My resolution was confusing to myself.  The call to action - additional areas impacting the issue.  Each area can then build a new chapter of the story.

# Take 2:  Setup, Conflict, Problem, Resolution
Simple, relevant information to build the problem.  Here it is:

<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/Carryover Story 2a.jpeg" alt="Carryover2a" width="300"> <img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/Carryover Story 2b.jpeg" alt="Carryover2b" width="300">
<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/Carryover Story 2c.jpeg" alt="Carryover2c" width="300">

So it may still look messy, but it builds through a series of charts the story of the U.S. Army's carryover challenge.  Only in the narrative does it briefly introduce two aspects, budget and workforce, that contributed to the issue.  There is likely more to the issue, and the last frame, the call to action, identifies five other areas to be explored further.  

# User research and interviews
Getting feedback on initial design is important to ensure the proper points are being made.  There were three different groups I focused my research, no military experience, military experience, but not budget related, and military experience with budget related carryover experience.  This approach gives me the most information to determine how to best present the information.

The questions below were used for two groups, no military experience and military experience, but not budget related.
- Can you tell me what you think I am working on?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

The questions below were used for an individual who is familiar with carryover:
- Does the intro flow?  
- Are there areas that should be included for readers having no idea about carryover or depot maintenance?
- The carryover calculation, are each of the descriptions clear and accurate?
- As it builds from 2006 to 2019, what do you think is the takeaway?  Any other areas I should include?
- The final slide, what does this lead you to?
