# Same Data - Three Different Perspectives

Finally, use Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization. 

You should now have three data visualizations on your page - the government debt bar chart, the grid of line charts and a third data visualization of your choosing using the same data, generated using Flourish.
