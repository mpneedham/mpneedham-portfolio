# Same Data - Three Different Perspectives

*The Data:* Downloaded from the OECD website and available for immediate.  An area of concern was that some countries were missing values for certain years.  I did not take the time to research why.  A possible reason could be based on membership years, i.e. they may have joined later or ended their membership.  A refinement I would make is to change the country abbreviations to the actual country name, as it may be difficult for readers to understand which country some of the country codes signify.

*Visual Comparison:* The three visuals attempt to show varying perspectives of government debt

- A Single Year (Bar Chart): The first chart shows data for 2018 by country in ascending order.  It is easy to compare countries as it relates to debt-to-GDP for that singular year.  The default color was grey, and had an order preference for highlighting selected countries.  The first county defaulted to red, the second to blue, and so forth.  Because of this, I limited it to Japan and the United States. 

- All Countries, All Years (Gird of Lines Chart):  The second chart shows data by each individual country, for the years 1995-2019 where data was available.  It can be used to compare over a larger period of time, by individual country.  Because of the density of the charts, I chose not to include the gridlines.  It offers more of a general trend perspective, and offers the ability for the user to hover over and get detailed point data if interested.  The chose grey as the color to keep it similar to the first chart default color.  

- All Countries, All Years (Focused Line Chart):  The third chart shows the same data as just explained, only into a single chart.  It can be used to see trends by country, but is intended to focus on Japan and the United States.  In 1995, both Japan and the United States was around 95% and can easily see the seperated growth of Japan from the United States until 2019.  It continues with the theme of grey for the overall general data, and then red for Japan and blue for the United States.  This way it remained consistent with the first chart.

*What I Would Refine:*  Learning Flourigh through developing these visualization was great.  If I were to use these visualizations, one thing to change would be the labeling of the countries on the chart.  I could not figure out how to modify the display, so the label for USA is not displayed next to, rather several lines above the chart line.  Another area to explore is the modification of the axis scale.  I could not find a way to specify adjustments to the axis scale, and if not available, would be a nice option.  I would have liked to display every 50 or 100, versus the 20 it defaulted to.
