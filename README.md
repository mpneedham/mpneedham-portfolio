This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at Carenegie Mellon University!

# About Me
[<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/ARMYandSTRENGTH200.png" alt="USAWC Fellowship" width="100">](https://www.armywarcollege.edu/programs/fellows.cfm) I am a United States Army War College Fellow in Information Technology and Strategy at CMU.  The fellowship helps prepare fellows for positions of broad scope in highly complex, ambiguous environments, often dealing with problems that have no clear-cut solutions.  Additional information on the fellowship progam can be found [here](https://www.armywarcollege.edu/programs/fellows.cfm).  

[<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/FA49LOGO.jpg" alt="FA49 Logo" width="100">](https://www.fa49.army.mil/index.html) I have twenty-one years of military service as an Army Field Artillery Officer and an [Operations Research Systems Analyst (ORSA)](https://www.fa49.army.mil/index.html).  ORSAs provide the Army uniquely skilled officers -- problem solvers -- who produce analysis and decision support products to underpin critical decisions by leaders and managers at all levels of the Department of Defense (DoD).

# What I Hope to Learn
An ORSA must be able to communicate the problem, analysis, and recommendations in an efficient, accurate, and compelling manner both written and orally.  Data visualization is critical for presenting complex data to focus the discussion with decision-makers.  I look forward to learning various data visualization techniques and tools, but also how to design effective visualizations.  Critique is an important way to improve, and I look forward to learning critique techniques and well as receiving class feedback.


# My Visualization Portfolio

  - Embeds chart directly from OECD website for 2018
