# About me
<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/ARMYandSTRENGTH200.png" alt="FA49 Logo" width="100"> I am a United States Army War College Fellow in Information Technology and Strategy at CMU.  The fellowship helps prepare fellows for positions of broad scope in highly complex, ambiguous environments, often dealing with problems that have no clear-cut solutions.  Additional information on the fellowship progam can be found [here](https://www.armywarcollege.edu/programs/fellows.cfm).  

<img src="/mpneedham-portfolio/FA49LOGO.jpg" alt="FA49 Logo" width="100"> I have twenty-one years of military service serving as an Army Field Artillery Officer and an [Operations Research Systems Analyst (ORSA)](https://www.fa49.army.mil/index.html).  ORSAs provide the Army uniquely skilled officers -- problem solvers -- who produce analysis and decision support products to underpin critical decisions by leaders and managers at all levels of the Department of Defense (DoD).
